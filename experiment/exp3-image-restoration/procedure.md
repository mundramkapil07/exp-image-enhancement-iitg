## Procedure

1. Load a clean image.
2. Add Gaussian noise.
3. Apply the Gaussian filter and the bilateral filter.
4. Add Salt & Pepper noise.
5. Apply median filter.
6. Apply NLM denoising on the noisy image.
7. Display outputs and compare visually; optionally compute PSNR/SSIM.

## Feedback

- Which filter gave best restoration?
- Did you observe edge blurring?
- Rate understanding of noise models (1–5).

## Additional Help

- Tip: Identify noise type first, then choose a filter.
