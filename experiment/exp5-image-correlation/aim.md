## Problem Statement
In many vision tasks, locating a smaller template inside a larger image is required (object
detection, tracking, registration). Correlation-based template matching computes similarity
across locations to find the best match.
Students will perform template matching using multiple correlation methods.

## Aim
To locate a known template within a larger image using spatial-domain correlation and analyze
matching accuracyTo locate a known template within a larger image using spatial-domain correlation and analyze matching accuracy.
