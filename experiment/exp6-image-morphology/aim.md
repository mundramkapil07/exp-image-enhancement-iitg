## Problem Statement
Binary images often contain noise, gaps, or irregular shapes. Morphological operations modify
an image’s structure using a structuring element to remove noise, separate objects, or fill in
holes.
Students will apply erosion, dilation, opening, and closing.

## Aim
To implement erosion and dilation and study their effects on object shape, noise removal, and
structural refinement.
