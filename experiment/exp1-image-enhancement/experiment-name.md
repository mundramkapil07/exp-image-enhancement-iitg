# **Image Enhancement**

Problem Statement
Digital images often suffer from poor contrast, uneven brightness, or low visibility of details
due to limitations in sensors or lighting conditions. Intensity transformation techniques modify
pixel values to enhance overall image appearance and make the image more suitable for visual
interpretation and further processing.
In this experiment, students will apply different intensity transformations—negative, gamma
correction, and contrast stretching—and analyze their effects on image brightness, contrast, and
detail visibility
