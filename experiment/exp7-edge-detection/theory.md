## Theory

Edges represent significant intensity transitions and define object boundaries.

1. Sobel Operator - First-derivative gradient-based operator.
2. Prewitt Operator - Similar to Sobel but uses uniform kernel weights.
3. Laplacian Operator - Second-order derivative highlighting rapid intensity changes.
4. Canny Edge Detector - Multi-stage optimal edge detector involving smoothing, gradient computation, nonmaximum suppression, and hysteresis thresholding.
