## Problem Statement
Images degrade due to motion blur or defocus blur. Simple inverse filtering may restore blur, but
fails in the presence of noise. Wiener filtering improves restoration by balancing blur inversion
and noise suppression.
Students will model blur and restore images using inverse and Wiener filtering.

##AIM
To implement frequency-domain restoration using inverse filtering and Wiener filtering on motion- and Gaussian-blurred images.
