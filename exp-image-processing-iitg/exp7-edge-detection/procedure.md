## Procedure

1. Load image and convert to grayscale.
2. Apply Sobel filters in x and y directions.
3. Compute gradient magnitude.
4. Apply Prewitt operator using custom kernels.
5. Apply Laplacian operator.
6. Apply Canny edge detection.
7. Display and compare outputs.

## Feedback

- Which operator gave the best edges?
- Was Canny threshold tuning clear?
