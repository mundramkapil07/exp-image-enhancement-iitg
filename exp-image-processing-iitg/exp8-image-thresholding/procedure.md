## Procedure

1. Load grayscale image.
2. Apply fixed binary threshold with chosen T.
3. Apply Otsu thresholding.
4. Apply adaptive mean thresholding.
5. Apply adaptive Gaussian thresholding.
6. Display and compare results.

## Feedback

- Which method segmented best?
- Was the global vs adaptive difference clear?

## Additional Help

- Smooth image slightly before Otsu if noisy.
